# ToDo List

1. Finish code and get ready to test.
 - 10/10 would todo again
 
 But on a more serious note, what needs to be done in the code?

2. Make everything work together
 - Finish all commands
 - Implement all commands

3. ~~Update all formatting and syntax to Google Style~~

4. Add drive base command -- talk to Jakob about what it should include

5. Add more witty comments 

6. ~~Fix swerve update thread class~~ -- Should be done (needs to be tested in simulation before being used on robot)

7. Move dead zone constants to Constants class

### When testing: 
1. If Robot.java is not found, it needs to be moved up a directory and [6746c70](https://github.com/FIRST-Team-1699/2016-offseason-code/commit/6746c70e8035c67caea27f189c6aaa782f46231f) needs to be undone.
2. Know that the code thinks linearly (360 degrees is different than 0 degrees), and operating near 0 degrees *may* have some unexpected consequences.
