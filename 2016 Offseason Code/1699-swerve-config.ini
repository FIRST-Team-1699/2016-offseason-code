// An configuration file with some static values for a swerve drive robot

// To find length and width:
// 1. Put the robot on the ground and find what the code considers to be the front.
// 2. Measure from front left to the back left and enter it in as the length (in inches).
// 3. Measure from the front left to the front right and enter it as the width (again, inches).
// When I reference front left, you can measure from the corner of the frame. 
// If the swerve module is not in the corner of the frame, measure it from where each wheel touches the ground.
// These are ratios, so you do not need to measure from a specific point, just keeping the way you measured constant.
